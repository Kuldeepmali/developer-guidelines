# ðŸ’» OpenST Developer Guidelines

## General Project Setup

* GitHub pull requests must require at least one review to allow merging.
* GitHub pull requests may only be merged using "merge commits" (no squash or rebase).
* All projects should have continuous integration setup using [TravisCI].
  * [TravisCI] must run unit tests and integration tests for every pull request.
  * [TravisCI] should run all applicable linters for every pull request.
  * GitHub pull requests must require that [TravisCI] passes to allow merging.
* All projects should have a `.gitignore` file that includes at least all build artifacts and auto-generated code (like `./build` or some generated content of `./lib`) and all dependencies (like `./node_modules`).
* Documentation should be in markdown format.
* Sign all your git commits and tags with your private key (and add the public key to your GitHub account).

Branches:

* `master` is the latest stable release.
* `develop` is the main branch and always reflects the latest development.
* `release-x.y` branches follow their respective release.

Every project must have the following files:

* `README.md`
  * For a layout of the readme see this [readme example].
  * Content should include (in this order):
    * Title followed by relevant badges using shields.io.
    * Introductory text.
    * *Instructions* section with help on installation and usage.
    * *Related Work* section.
    * *Contributing* section with.
      * help on setup and testing.
      * a link to this guide.
      * links to [discourse] and [gitter].
* `LICENSE`
* `CHANGELOG.md`
  * For the layout of the changelog see this [changelog example].
  * Notable changes should link to their pull request(s) using absolute links.

Ports:

If your project runs processes that require ports on the host, for example ganache, the following ports should be used.
We define ranges here so that you can select one or more ports inside the range *that should not conflict with the ports of the other repositories.*

* Ganache: `50000 - 50999`
* Integration test containers: `51000 - 51999`
* Other processes: `52000 - 52999`

ThisÂ should avoid port conflicts as much as possible.
It should furthermore rule out the case where, for example, tests of a repository pass or fail because another, differently configured ganache from another repository is still running.

## Releases

Version identifiers follow [Semantic Versioning 2] without a leading `v`.
A valid version identifier would be for example `0.10.3` or `0.5.1-alpha.3`.

Every **MINOR** version must have its dedicated git branch.
For example, versions `0.10.x` would go into the release branch `release-0.10` whereas versions `1.2.x` would go into release branch `release-1.2`.
Release branches must start with `release-` followed by **MAJOR** and **MINOR** version identifier separated by a period.

Every release that shall be published must be tagged in git (on GitHub).
Pre-releases (e.g. `-alpha.3`) must only have an annotated tag.
Releases (e.g. `0.10.0`) must have an accompanying GitHub release with release notes.

Before merging the latest changes from `develop` into a release branch:

* Every release and pre-release must make sure that the `CHANGELOG` reflects all relevant changes and is up-to-date.
* Every release and pre-release must make sure that the version listed in `package.json` is correct.

## Solidity

* Follow our [Solidity style guide].
* Any project with Solidity code should have [ethlint] (formerly solium) installed.
  * Use this configuration: [soliumrc].
  * Make sure all changes pass the linter before opening a pull request.

### Directory Structure

* All contract source code should be below the directory `./contracts`.
* All unit test and related code should be below the directory `./test`.
* All integration test and related code should be below the directory `./test_integration`.
* All build artifacts of a library project should be in the directory `./lib`.
* All documentation should be below the directory `./docs`.

## JavaScript

* Follow the [Airbnb style guide].
* Any project with JavaScript code should have [eslint] installed.
  * Use this configuration: [eslintrc].
  * Make sure all changes pass the linter before opening a pull request.

### Directory Structure

* All source code should be below the directory `./src`.
* All unit test and related code should be below the directory `./test`.
* All integration test and related code should be below the directory `./test_integration`.
* All build artifacts of a library project should be in the directory `./lib`.
* All documentation should be below the directory `./docs`.

### Logging 

* [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) should be used as logging library.
* By default logging to console should be enabled .
* It should be possible to switch from console to file logging by updating an environment variable. 
```bash
export ENABLE_PROJECT_NAME_LOGGER=true

```
* Logger should support below log levels:
    * error
    * warn
    * info
    * verbose
    * debug
    * silly

* Default log level should be `info`.  
* It should be possible to change log level by updating an environment variable.   
```bash
export ENABLE_PROJECT_NAME_LOG_LEVEL=error

```
* Default log location should be `${PWD}/log`.
* It should be able to change log location by updating an environment variable.  
  ```
  export PROJECT_NAME_LOGGER_PATH=/path
  ```
## `package.json`

This section applies to Solidity and JavaScript projects alike.

* `package.json` should include all required build steps in `scripts.prepack`.
* Provide at least the following `package.json` scripts:
  * `test`
  * `test:integration`
  * `build`
  * `prepack`
    * Should run all steps required before packing (publishing) the project (probably at least `npm run build`).
    * When you use a packaging tool like [webpack], make sure that `npm ci` is part of the `prepack` script.
  * `lint`
* Define `files` to minimize the size of the published package.
* For library projects, `main` should point to `./lib/index.js`.

## Rust

* Format your code using `rustfmt`.

## Pull Requests

_The following assumes that code and other work will continue to be stored on GitHub and that ZenHub will be the management tool_.

A Pull Request (PR), which is a request for changing content within a repository, can be opened at anytime.

Ideally, a PR is small, limited to a single objective, and in response to a specific GitHub issue.

The PR is the only place any team member is expected to consult for information about the PR or its lifecycle.

### Summary

* a PR is its source of truth
* a PR should be connected to the relevant issue(s)
* the reviewer who takes up review formally as an item of work should self-assign on the PR
* comments on the PR should be limited to the PR
* comments about the PR should only be made on the PR
* when the review ends, because the assignee either completes the review or will not complete the review, assignment should be cleared
* at the end of a completed review, the assignee should bounce or merge the PR

### Format

The PR should be connected using ZenHub to any issues to which it is a response. If the PR resolves an issue, that should be indicated in the body of the PR (e.g., "Resolves #70", "Fixes #71", etc.).

The PR's title and description should collectively address the following:
* what is the purpose of these changes
* what has changed
* any information pertinent to this particular PR's review that are not generally true of PRs in the repo (e.g., assumptions, dependencies, departures from normal practice, offline agreements, etc.)
* any additional information helpful for review (and posterity!)

### Review

If a PR is ready for review, the PR should be moved into the review pipeline (if it was not already there) and any assignees should be cleared.

#### Assignment

_The following assumes there is a single assignee for a PR. Should there be multiple assignees, apply sensible adjustments._

The question of the best use of "Reviewers" and "Assignees" on GitHub appears to be open to debate. However, two features of our setup resolve the matter:
* GitHub automatically lists anyone who adds a comment to a PR as a reviewer
* ZenHub does not filter by reviewers, only by assignees and authors

**On a PR, the person formally taking up the task of review, and who therefore accepts responsibility if she decides the work can be merged, should be set as the assignee.** This supports quick and simple assessment of resources via the ZenHub board. Others can, of course, review if they have capacity/interest and add their comments (doing so will automatically list them as reviewers), but they are not considered responsible for completion of the review.

Generally speaking, the assignee self-assigns to the PR and, ideally, self-clears as necessary. If the assignee cannot complete review, that assignment should be cleared from the PR. In doing so, the PR will appear unassigned in the review pipeline on the ZenHub board and others will know that PR's review is available as a task to pick up. If the PR is not in a reviewable state, this can be reflected by moving the PR out of the review pipeline and/or assignment to the person responsible for addressing the state of the PR, according to any workflow policies or as deemed sensible.

Clearing an assignment from an open PR in the review pipeline should be accompanied with an explanatory comment on the PR. When a review is completed in the normal GitHub flow (i.e., by providing a review comment with a required status such as "Request changes"), the assignment should be cleared. _For the avoidance of doubt, there is no need to add an additional comment explaining clearance of the assignment in the case of normal review completion._

#### Comments

Generally speaking, comments in relation to the PR (e.g. on closing, assignment, questions, change requests, etc.) should be made on the PR, and not on related issues.

Generally speaking, if a comment does not concern the content or status of the PR, it should not be made on the PR. For example, a comment that the related issue was not sufficiently defined should be made on the issue, not on the PRâ€”if the PR needs to be changed as a result of such comment, that will be reflected in changes to the PR (e.g., new or edited commits, closure, etc.).

If a PR is closed but not merged, the closure should be accompanied with an explanatory comment.

**Always speaking, comments should reflect empathy and respect for the author of the PR as well as the other team members.**

#### Completion of a review

Upon completion of a review from the PR's assignee, in the normal course, the PR should be bounced or merged.

In addition to any other applicable PR-handling policies, **the PR should not be merged without a review completed in the normal GitHub flow from the PR's assignee.**
